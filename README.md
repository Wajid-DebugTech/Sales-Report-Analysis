# Sales-Report-Analysis

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of Amazon product listing data to uncover patterns in pricing, discounts, ratings, and customer engagement. It starts with data ingestion and cleaning where price fields, discount percentages, rating counts, and rating values are sanitized and converted into numeric types; malformed or placeholder values are handled and missing data is addressed. Following preparation, exploratory data analysis reveals distributions and relationships using histograms for discounted and actual prices, rating and review count distributions, and correlation matrices to assess associations among discount percentage, rating, and review volume. To segment products into meaningful cohorts, the analysis applies K-Means clustering on scaled features — average rating, rating counts, and discount percentage — and uses the elbow method to identify an appropriate number of clusters. Visualization techniques include scatterplots, category-wise trend charts, and a 3D scatter visualization that maps cluster assignments across rating, review count, and discount dimensions. An aggregated category dataset is used to label clusters and improve interpretability. Overall, the project delivers actionable insights: identifying category segments that respond to discounts, highlighting products with organic engagement, and informing pricing and promotional strategies. The notebook documents reproducible steps from cleaning through modeling and visualization to support data-driven merchandising decisions.
